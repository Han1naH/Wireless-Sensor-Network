# Wireless-Sensor-Network

A wireless sensor network (WSN) are spatially distributed autonomous sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions and to cooperatively pass their data through the network to a main location. WSNs have been widely used in a variety of areas in the modern society. So, it is of great importance to model and study them.
In this project, several random geometric graphs are used to model the wireless sensor network. Distribution of these graphs includes unit square, disk with unit radius and sphere. They are used to model WSN in different situations. The communication backbones are vital to the connectivity of WSN. To identify a backbone with high dominant percentage, nodes of WSN need to be ordered appropriately [3]. An efficient way is to use the smallest-last ordering algorithm. After ordering and coloring the nodes, backbones could be selected from bipartite subgraphs, which are built on different color sets.
This project creates a precise model for WSN in both local and global areas. They could be used to study WSN and find communication backbones effectively. By employing efficient algorithms, resource required to run these models are significantly saved.
